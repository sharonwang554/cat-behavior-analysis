   - **Behavioral Context**: High urgency, excitement, impatience, demanding immediate attention

7. **Descending Pitch Patterns** ✅

   - **Detection**: High pitch variation + medium-high starting pitch + mellow spectral centroid
   - **Meaning**: "Descending pitch pattern - disappointment or resignation vocalization, often after unmet expectations"
   - **Behavioral Context**: Disappointment, resignation, mild frustration, unmet expectations

8. **Ascending Pitch Patterns** ✅

   - **Detection**: High pitch variation + short duration + bright spectral centroid
   - **Meaning**: "Ascending pitch pattern - question-like vocalization indicating uncertainty or seeking confirmation"
   - **Behavioral Context**: Uncertainty, questioning, seeking confirmation or permission

9. **Harmonic Richness** ✅
   - **Detection**: Balanced spectral centroid (2000-4000Hz) + smooth texture + moderate variation
   - **Meaning**: "Harmonically rich vocalization - emotionally complex communication with sophisticated tonal qualities"
   - **Behavioral Context**: Emotional sophistication, complex communication intent, nuanced expression

## ⏰ Contextual Analysis - ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Time-of-Day Pattern Recognition:

1. **Morning Demand Patterns** ✅

   - **Detection**: High loudness + high pitch + short duration
   - **Context**: "Morning demand characteristics - loud, high-pitched, brief vocalizations typical of breakfast requests"
   - **Timing**: Early morning (6-9 AM)

2. **Evening Social Patterns** ✅
   - **Detection**: Medium pitch + expressive variation + longer duration + balanced spectral centroid
   - **Context**: "Evening social characteristics - moderate pitch with expressive variation, typical of social interaction"
   - **Timing**: Evening (6-10 PM)

### Urgency Cluster Analysis:

3. **High Urgency Clusters** ✅

   - **Multi-factor scoring**: Loudness + short duration + pitch variation + high pitch
   - **Detection**: Score ≥4 triggers "Critical" urgency level
   - **Meaning**: "Multiple indicators suggest immediate need or high motivation"

4. **Moderate Urgency Clusters** ✅
   - **Detection**: Score 2-3 triggers "Moderate" urgency level
   - **Meaning**: "Some urgency indicators present - attention desired, routine request"

### Breath Pattern Analysis:

5. **Irregular Breath Patterns** ✅

   - **Detection**: High loudness variation + high zero crossing rate
   - **Health Concern**: "May indicate stress or respiratory issues"
   - **Recommendation**: Monitor for stress or respiratory problems

6. **Controlled Breath Patterns** ✅
   - **Detection**: Low loudness variation + low zero crossing rate
   - **Health Indicator**: "Good respiratory control and calm state"
   - **Meaning**: Relaxed, controlled communication

## 🏥 Health Monitoring System - ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Comprehensive Health Assessment:

1. **Respiratory Health Assessment** ✅

   - **High Concern** (ZCR >0.12): "Significant vocal roughness - may indicate respiratory distress"
   - **Low Concern** (ZCR 0.08-0.12): "Mild vocal roughness - could indicate minor throat irritation"
   - **Healthy** (ZCR <0.04): "Clean, clear vocal production indicating good respiratory health"

2. **Vocal Strain Assessment** ✅

   - **Detection**: High volume + high variation
   - **Warning**: "May indicate vocal strain from excessive vocalization or underlying discomfort"

3. **Energy Level Assessment** ✅

   - **Low Energy Detection**: Very quiet + very mellow spectral centroid
   - **Warning**: "May indicate lethargy, illness, or depression"
   - **Recommendation**: "Monitor for other signs of illness, changes in appetite"

4. **Neurological Function Assessment** ✅

   - **Detection**: Extreme pitch variation (>150Hz) in long vocalizations
   - **Concern**: "May indicate neurological issues or extreme distress"
   - **Recommendation**: "Veterinary evaluation if pattern persists"

5. **Age-Related Changes** ✅
   - **Detection**: Low pitch + mild roughness + mellow spectral centroid
   - **Assessment**: "May indicate age-related vocal changes in senior cats"
